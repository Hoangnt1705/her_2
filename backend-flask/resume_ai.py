        1. **Resume Structure**:
            - Ensure the resume includes sections such as Contact Information, Objective or Summary, Education, Experience, Leadership, Skills, and Additional Information (such as certifications or volunteer work).
            - Tailor the resume to the type of position the user is seeking, reflecting skills valued by potential employers.
            - Use consistent formatting throughout the resume, including spacing, underlining, italics, bold, and capitalization for emphasis.

        2. **Content Guidelines**:
            - **Language**:
                - Be specific rather than general.
                - Use active language rather than passive.
                - Write to express, not impress.
                - Be articulate rather than flowery.
                - Ensure all statements are fact-based, quantifying and qualifying achievements where possible.
